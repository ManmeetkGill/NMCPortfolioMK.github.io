                disney and fantasy genre books, I thought why not combine the two into an app!

                <div class="description">Hello! My name is Manmeet Gill and I created this app called Treasy! The purpose of this app is to give a fun way for
                users to interact with different European countries while at the same time giving them a chance to learn more about the
                different cities and destinations that these countries have to offer. I love traveling and have always wanted to visit
                Europe so this was a perfect way for me to also get to know some places that I will hopefully want to visit some day!
                    
                    <br><br>
                    By clicking a country from the drop down menu, you can initiate the start button! Once you get to the next page you will
                    be able to swipe through
                    different cities and if at any point you want to learn more about a particular city, you can hold the picture of the
                    city and it will give you
                    the option to either see the map of the city or learn about particular destinations within the city. If you choose the
                    second option, you will reach
                    a separate page that will give you a couple of destinations that list the name, suggested duration, key theme, and the
                    cost of visiting that destination. To learn
                    more about each destination, you can simply click on the picture of the destination and read the description!
