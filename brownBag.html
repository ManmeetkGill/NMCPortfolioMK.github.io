                    <div class="description">Home to the Innovation Hub, Digital Brown Bag has taught me so much on how to grow not just academically but also professionally. I was able to meet and ask 
                        questions to incoming speakers such as Shelby Clayton from Twitter and Ben Bolton from Verizon. Every one of the speakers talked not only just about what they did, but they also just talked about general life advice for when they were
                        in college and how they are where they are at now. I learned that progress is not linear but instead its about pushing your way up regardless. I am 
                        so happy to have gotten the opportunity to take part in this experience!</div>

                    <div class="description">One of my favorite things that we did for NMIX was when we created our very own business cards to hand out to speakers and connections we met throughout our time in college. The professionalism
                        that came with having a business card was so amazing! Along with the business card, we got to learn a lot about relevant topics like how to utilize a credit card efficiently and what it means to have health insurance! The structure of the class itself
                        was so professional in that attendance, work policy, etc were all structured the way a real job would be. I got to learn so many insiders on what it means to work at an actual job!

                    <div class="description">Throughout this semester, we were also tasked with picking out 3 professional development tasks that would get us to be introspective about ourselves and our goals for our careers. The three tasks that I choose
                        were Personality Assessment, Credit Cards, and Digital Identity. The first one gave me more insight on my credit score and why I had the score that I did. The second one went more in depth with the social media I was using and in what ways 
                        it developed me professionally. The third one was actually very interesting. I was able to assess the type of person I was, and based on this, I was given job titles that would suit me best! These tasks were so much fun!

                    <br>
                    <p>New Media Production (4110) has been a truly wonderful experience. Professor Aldridge and my fellow classmates were so
                    helpful and I really felt like I was able to reach my full creative potential! By the way, check out my awesome work.</p>

                    <h2>All the things I've learned</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>This class was very project oriented and each week we were given a particluar set of topics to learn and experiment
                    with. We learned everything from the basics of Stack User Interfaces all the way to creating our owen actual working
                    applications about topics we were passionate about. These applications utilized animations, gestures, dynamic lists,
                    action and context menus, and many many more tools! Feel free to browse through some of my projects.</p>

                    <h2>MY TAKEAWAYS...</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>I think my biggest takeway from this class is that creativity has no limit. There are so many cool things out there and
                    so many ways that I can make my ideas turn into reality. Professor Aldridge really allowed to stretch our limits when it
                    came to building our applications and I am so grateful because it taught me how to push myself and make something that I
                    could be proud of.</p>
