                    based on the characters of the show. 
                    <br><br>
                   To do this, I created a New Girl API through json and a platform called Heroku to run it on. I used a function called qa to create the bases
                   of all of the questions. To randomize which answer choice was correct I used math.random! After the user presses on an a checkbox they can chack their answer
                   using the button I created underneath each question. Creating the project
                   was definitely very challenging but it was so fun to create a product involving something I really liked: New Girl!

                <div class="description"> This is a website that I and a few other teammates created called Seasonal Delights. The purpose of this site is to provide
                    a platform for users to save their favorite recipes. This would allow users to have all the information they need in a database that could be accessed 
                    from virtually anywhere and also allow the recipes to be visually appealing. Now users would no longer have to create handwritten recipes or put them on word
                    documents etc. 
                    
                    <br><br>
                    To get into the site, the first task is to register your own username and password in the case that you haven't already. Once that is done, you will 
                    be able to do a couple of things. The homepage first gives you an option of searching up some of our default recipes in case you need ideas of what the recipe format is going to be like. Once the user types in 
                    the item, the site will take them to another pade that includes a picture of the item they are looking for, ingredients, and instructions on how to make the food
                    item. The main factor of this site is the ability of the user to add in their own recipes to the database. By clicking on the add recipe tab, once the user adds in all 
                    the necessary information, the database will update and if that user searches up that item, it will now show up. Another feature of this site is that if 
                    you are unsure of what food item you have in the database or what that food item is called, you can go the tab called Keyword list, and it will show you not only what items have been searched, but
                    also the frequency at which they are searched!

                <div class="description">This is an app I created called Disney-Fantasy Clash!. In this app users will be able to choose their favorite Disney
                princess and get fantasy book recommendations that correlate with that princess's story! Since I am a fanatic of both
                disney and fantasy genre books, I thought why not combine the two into an app!
                <br><br>
                By pressing the start here button, you will be sent to a view that allows you to pick between 8 princess. Once you click
                on a princess, it will take a view to that allows you to look at 3 different books that correlate to that princess's
                story! If you click on the book, you will see the author name as well as the synopsis of the book! If you have time,
                feel free to add your feedback to the app as well using the 'If you have a bit of time' button! Thank you so much for
                using the App, and I hope you enjoy!</div>
