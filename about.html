                    <p>This class was very project oriented and each week we were given a particluar set of topics to learn and experiment
                    with. We learned everything from the basics of Stack User Interfaces all the way to creating our owen actual working
                    applications about topics we were passionate about. These applications utilized animations, gestures, dynamic lists,
                    action and context menus, and many many more tools! Feel free to browse through some of my projects.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>I think my biggest takeway from this class is that creativity has no limit. There are so many cool things out there and
                    so many ways that I can make my ideas turn into reality. Professor Aldridge really allowed to stretch our limits when it
                    came to building our applications and I am so grateful because it taught me how to push myself and make something that I
                    could be proud of.</p>
